# Hi! I'm Feli 👋

iOS dev • sketchnoting • accessibility • photography • pineapple on pizza • lioness • she/her

## What I'm working on in my free time

- I make sketchnotes and write blogs posts (you can find them on [my website][website])
- Improving my website, learning more about CSS & HTML and Best Practices in Frontend Development
- I like to play around with APIs or new features, which I always wanted to try out and use them in [Cineaste App (iOS)][cineaste], if it makes sense for the app
- I'm glad I discovered [Critical Maps (iOS)][criticalmaps] where I can contribute to and help maintaining the project 🚲

## More of this

- 😎 Images with alt texts
- 🗣 Giving and receiving constructive feedback
- 🎨 Time for drawing, lettering and sketchnoting
- 🧗‍♀️ Being outside, e.g. for climbing and playing football
- 💬 Asynchronous communication
- 🌤 Blue sky with (some) clouds

## Less of this

- 😩 Meetings without goal and agenda
- 🙉 Open workspaces without an area to concentrate and focus
